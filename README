NAME
    Perinci::Sub::Property::exit_on_error - Die on non-success result

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Without exit_on_error:

     # on successful call
     f(...); # [200, "OK"]

     # on non-successful call
     f(...); # [404, "Not found"]

    With "exit_on_error => 1":

     # on successful call
     f(...); # [200, "OK"]

     # on non-successful call
     f(...); # print message "Call f() failed with 404 status: Not found" to STDERR and exits 104

    To customize what statuses are considered error: "exit_on_error => {
    success_statuses => '^2..$' }".

DESCRIPTION
    This property sets so that function calls "exit()" when result status is
    a non-successful one. Successful statuses by default include 2xx and 304
    ('^(2..|304)$').

    Exit code is currently set to (like in Perinci::CmdLine) and might be
    customizable in the future.
